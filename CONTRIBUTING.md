# Contributing

### Yay!! Congratulations on your first step to open source code! And hello to those who are not so new to this world 😁

#### My goal is to make this project low pressure and fun. This project has A LOT of work that needs to be done and with your help perhaps we can create a fun game together.

## 🍭 Who is this repo for?

### All are welcome to contribute but my goal is to make this a low-pressure project for those who are learning git and git hub and those who are just dipping their toes into open source work.

If you know Javascript, html, or css this project should be very easy for you to jump into. However, this codebase is not pretty. There are A LOT of repeating functions and other things that could be cleaner that could use some work. This project was created out of my love for mentorship and community so if you have any questions or need clarifications please feel free to ask.

## 🤔What should I do now??

### Great question! For starters, play the game [here](https://alexandria.github.io/match-three-game/index.html)!

Is there anything specific that you want to be added or improved on? If so, make a [ new issue](https://github.com/Alexandria/match-three-game/issues/new) request and specify what you think needs to be tweaked or added.

## 🧙🏾What if I am not a coder?

### If you are not a coder no problem! Documentation would be a massive help for this project. Examples of that would be:

- Fixing any of my numerous spelling errors ( even the ones in this contributing doc)
- Update the gifs in the README to be a more recent example of the current gameplay
- Anything else you can think of that relates to describing the game and how it works.

## 🙅🏾 Please do not steal any art or music assets

Currently, all the art is custom pixel art that I made, and yeah I know it's rough. 😅 With that being said if you want to update any art assets or add sound assets to the game they must be royalty free or you must have permission from the artist to use their work in this project before submitting it. And of course, you will need to give credit to the artist.

## Final notes

### This contributing doc itself is STILL being worked on, if you feel like there is some additional information that needs to be added, then create an [issue](https://github.com/Alexandria/match-three-game/issues/new/choose) and I or another contributor will look into it.
